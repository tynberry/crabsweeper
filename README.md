# Crabsweeper

Just a little small crab themed minesweeper. This idea came to me from the Sanctuary discord server.
Unlike the regular minesweeper, you aren't trying to find all the mines without blowing up, but are
trying to find all the crabs with using as least spaces as possible.

## Controls

Mouse
Left Click -> uncover space
Right Click -> (un)mark space as empty, only as a marker, does nothing gameplay wise
